*Developer, DevOps enthusiast, father.*

I have been working as a Software Engineer and as a consultant since 2012 with
clients of various sizes. While Iâ€™m a proficient fullstack developer, my
expertise is in building scalable backend services.

I see myself as somewhat of a polyglot developer. I have professional
experience working with **Go**, **Java**, **Python**, **Bash**, and I have
dabbled in many more - Haskell, Erlang, Scala, Ruby, to name a few.

Other tools and technologies I'm proficient with include Amazon Web Services,
Google Cloud Platform, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, etc. 

My editor of choice is **Vim**. UNIX is a marvellous IDE in and of itself. With
that said, I'm certainly no stranger to the likes of IntelliJ and Eclipse.

While technology and building stuff are passions of mine, and working in this
area brings me great joy, I also enjoy spending time with my family, working
out, mindfulness, board games, and having a beer or two with friends.
